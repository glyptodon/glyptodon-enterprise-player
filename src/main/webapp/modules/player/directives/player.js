/**
 * Directive which plays back Glyptodon Enterprise / Apache Guacamole session

 * within the current recording:
 *
 *     "glenPlayerLoading":
 *         A new recording has been selected and is now loading.
 *
 *     "glenPlayerProgress"
 *         Additional data has been loaded for the current recording and the
 *         recording's duration has changed. The new duration in milliseconds
 *         is passed to the event.
 *
 *     "glenPlayerLoaded"
 *         The current recording has finished loading.
 *
 *     "glenPlayerPlay"
 *         Playback of the current recording has started or has been resumed.
 *
 *     "glenPlayerPause"
 *         Playback of the current recording has been paused.
 *
 *     "glenPlayerSeek"
 *         The playback position of the current recording has changed. The new
 *         position within the recording is passed to the event as the number
 *         of milliseconds since the start of the recording.
